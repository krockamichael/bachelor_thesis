# lua-klesi/test

This is a series of test packages that should run quietly and without error.
After klesi is installed, all the scripts could be tested with a simple
`lua test/*.lua`. If any errors occur, please [create a ticket][1]! If you
do not have a GitHub account, then you can [send me a letter][2].
