# JSON Threat Protection plugin for Kong
[![][t1t-logo]][Trust1Team-url]

Kong is a scalable, open source API Layer *(also known as an API Gateway, or
API Middleware)*. Kong was originally built at [Mashape][mashape-url] to
secure, manage and extend over [15,000 APIs &
Microservices](http://stackshare.io/mashape/how-mashape-manages-over-15000-apis-and-microservices)
for its API Marketplace, which generates billions of requests per month.

Backed by the battle-tested **NGINX** with a focus on high performance, Kong
was made available as an open-source platform in 2015. Under active
development, Kong is now used in production at hundreds of organizations from
startups, to large enterprises and government departments.

## Summary

Like XML-based services, APIs that support JavaScript object notation (JSON) are vulnerable to content-level attacks. Simple JSON attacks attempt to use structures that overwhelm JSON parsers to crash a service and induce application-level denial-of-service attacks. All settings are optional and should be tuned to optimize your service requirements against potential vulnerabilities.

Only works from Kong 0.8.0

| array_element_count      | 0             | FALSE    | Specifies the maximum number of elements allowed in an array. If you do not specify this element, or if you specify a negative integer, the system does not enforce a limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| container_depth          | 0             | FALSE    | Specifies the maximum allowed containment depth, where the containers are objects or arrays. For example, an array containing an object which contains an object would result in a containment depth of 3. If you do not specify this element, or if you specify a negative integer, the system does not enforce any limit.                                                                    |
| object_entry_count       | 0             | FALSE    | Specifies the maximum number of entries allowed in an object. If you do not specify this element, or if you specify a negative integer, the system does not enforce any limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| object_entry_name_length | 0             | FALSE    | Specifies the maximum string length allowed for a property name within an object. If you do not specify this element, or if you specify a negative integer, the system does not enforce any limit.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| string_value_length      | 0             | FALSE    | Specifies the maximum length allowed for a string value. If you do not specify this element, or if you specify a negative integer, the system does not enforce a limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
