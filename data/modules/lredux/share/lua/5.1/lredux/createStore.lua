    Creates a Redux store that holds the state tree.
    The only way to change the data in the store is to call `dispatch()` on it.

    There should only be a single store in your app. To specify how different
    parts of the state tree respond to actions, you may combine several reducers
    into a single reducer function by using `combineReducers`.

    @param {function} reducer A function that returns the next state tree, given
    the current state tree and the action to handle.

    @param {any} [preloadedState] The initial state. You may optionally specify it
    to hydrate the state from the server in universal apps, or to restore a
    previously serialized user session.
    If you use `combineReducers` to produce the root reducer function, this must be
    an object with the same shape as `combineReducers` keys.

    @param {function} [enhancer] The store enhancer. You may optionally specify it
    to enhance the store with third-party capabilities such as middleware,
    time travel, persistence, etc. The only store enhancer that ships with Redux
    is `applyMiddleware()`.

    @returns {store} A Redux store that lets you read the state, dispatch actions
    and subscribe to changes.

        Adds a change listener. It will be called any time an action is dispatched,
        and some part of the state tree may potentially have changed. You may then
        call `getState()` to read the current state tree inside the callback.

        You may call `dispatch()` from a change listener, with the following
        caveats:

        1. The subscriptions are snapshotted just before every `dispatch()` call.
        If you subscribe or unsubscribe while the listeners are being invoked, this
        will not have any effect on the `dispatch()` that is currently in progress.
        However, the next `dispatch()` call, whether nested or not, will use a more
        recent snapshot of the subscription list.

        2. The listener should not expect to see all state changes, as the state
        might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
        the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
        registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
        state by the time it exits.

        @param {function} listener A callback to be invoked on every dispatch.
        @returns {function} A function to remove this change listener.

        Dispatches an action. It is the only way to trigger a state change.

        The `reducer` function, used to create the store, will be called with the
        current state tree and the given `action`. Its return value will
        be considered the **next** state of the tree, and the change listeners
        will be notified.

        The base implementation only supports table actions. If you want to
        dispatch something else, you need to
        wrap your store creating function into the corresponding middleware. Even the
        middleware will eventually dispatch table actions using this method.

        @param {table} action A table representing “what changed”. It is
        a good idea to keep actions serializable so you can record and replay user
        sessions. An action must have
        a `type` property which may not be `nil`. It is a good idea to use
        string constants for action types.

        @returns {table} For convenience, the same action table you dispatched.

        Note that, if you use a custom middleware, it may wrap `dispatch()` to
        return something else.
