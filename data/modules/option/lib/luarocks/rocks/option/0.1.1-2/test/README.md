# Option tests

## Instructions

Make sure the option module is in your path. If you installed it
locallly, simply type in this command if you haven't already:

    $ eval $(luarocks path)

To ensure that all the tests work, simply type the following:

    path/to/lua-option/test $ lua *.lua

If everything passes silently, then all is well.
