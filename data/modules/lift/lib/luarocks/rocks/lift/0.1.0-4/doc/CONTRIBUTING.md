## Submitting Issues

  You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself.

## Philosophy

Lift's _raison d'Ãªtre_ is to promote the development of top-notch tools in Lua,
and thus help the Lua ecosystem to evolve.

Lift stands for _Lua Infrastructure For Tools_.
And it helps your project to fly!

Design priorities are simplicity first, then conciseness and then efficiency.
In line with Lua's philosophy we should offer maximal value, minimal code,
and concise and precise documentation.
