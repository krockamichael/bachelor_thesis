# LuaTableDiff

LuaTableDiff is a Lua snippet that allows to create diffs recursively
between two Lua tables. This diff can then again be applied to the
original unmodified table to reconstruct the modified table.

This could be used to reduce the amount of data needed to be transmitted
in order to synchronize two tables. Beware that there is some overhead
especially for nested tables with only few entries.

It provides two functions:

    ltdiff = require "ltdiff"
    diff = ltdiff.diff (old_table, new_table)

This function creates the diff and returns it.

    ltdiff = require "ltdiff"
    new_table = ltdiff.patch (old_table, diff)

Modifies old\_table by applying the diff. This function directly modifies old\_table!

# Example
    require 'strict'
    ltdiff = require 'ltdiff'
    utils = require 'utils'

    local this = {
       a = 1.1,
       b = 7.2,
       deeper = {
          s1 = 1.0,
          s2 = 2.0
       },
    }
    
    local other = {
       a = 1.4,
       b = 7.2,
       deeper = {
          s1 = 1.0,
          s2 = 2.0,
          new = 9.1
       }
    }
    
    local other_copy = utils.deepcopy (other)
    
    local diff = ltdiff.diff (this, other)
    print ("this = " .. utils.serialize(this))
    print ("other = " .. utils.serialize(other))
    print ("diff = " .. utils.serialize(diff))
    
    local patched = ltdiff.patch (this, diff)
    print ("patched = " .. utils.serialize(patched))
    
    if utils.deepcompare (other_copy, patched) then
       print ("OK")
    else
       print ("ERROR patched != other_copy")
    end

The diff table in this case would look something like this:

    diff = {
      sub = {
        deeper = {
          mod = {
            new = 9.1,
          },
        },
      },
      mod = {
        a = 1.4,
      },
    }
