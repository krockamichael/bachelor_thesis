Get a list of supported algorithms for the given method_type. The method_type parameter is equivalent to method_type in libssh2_session_method_pref. If successful, the function will allocate the appropriate amount of memory. When not needed anymore, it must be deallocated by calling libssh2_free. When this function is unsuccessful, this must not be done.
In order to get a list of all supported compression algorithms, libssh2_session_flag(session, LIBSSH2_FLAG_COMPRESS, 1) must be called before calling this function, otherwise only "none" will be returned.
If successful, the function will allocate and fill the array with supported algorithms (the same names as defined in RFC 4253).  The array is not NULL terminated.
