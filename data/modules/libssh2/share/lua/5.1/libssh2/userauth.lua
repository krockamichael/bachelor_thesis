description: session - Session instance as returned by libssh2_session_init_ex.
username - Name of user to attempt keyboard-interactive authentication for.
username_len - Length of username parameter.
response_callback - As authentication proceeds, the host issues several (1 or more) challenges and requires responses. This callback will be called at this moment. The callback is responsible to obtain responses for the challenges, fill the provided data structure and then return control. Responses will be sent to the host. String values will be free(3)ed by the library. The callback prototype must match this:
Â void response(const char *name,
 Â int name_len, const char *instruction,

 Â int num_prompts,
 Â const LIBSSH2_USERAUTH_KBDINT_PROMPT *prompts,

Attempts keyboard-interactive (challenge/response) authentication.
Note that many SSH servers will always issue a single "password" challenge, requesting actual password as response, but it is not required by the protocol, and various authentication schemes, such as smartcard authentication may use keyboard-interactive authentication type too.

Attempt basic password authentication. Note that many SSH servers  which appear to support ordinary password authentication actually have  it disabled and use Keyboard Interactive authentication (routed via  PAM or another authentication backed) instead.
