#         Classy -- Lua Module for Class-Based OO Programming        #

##                           Introduction                           ##

Lua doesn't have classes and objects builtin, but provides mechanisms
to define your own helper functions for object oriented programming.
Many Lua programmers have done so, this module is one such attempt.

Features:

*   Simple object layout

    The objects are just tables with a common metatable per class for
    looking up methods. All instance variables are stored in the
    object table, and there are no `__index`-chains for inheritance.
    Therefore, there is very little overhead (both runtime, and
    memory).

*   Multiple inheritance

    A class can inherit from multiple base classes. The inherited
    methods are looked up in width-first search order at class
    creation time (or when a base class is updated).

*   Multimethods

    In case you need polymorphism for more than a single argument,
    this module allows you to define multimethods. The dispatch works
    for classes created via this module, and for builtin types.

*   Easy definition of (meta-)methods

    Storing a new field in the class table will make it available in
    objects of this class and all derived classes. If the new field
    name is one of the valid metatable keys, the function is stored in
    the object's metatable instead. Only adding previously undefined
    metamethods is allowed this way, however (no overwriting of
    existing ones). So you can add *new* operator overloads to objects
    without direct access to their metatable.

*   Common utility functions

    The module provides common utility functions, for e.g. detecting
    the class of an object, or figuring out if a class inherits from a
    certain other class.


##                          Getting Started                         ##

This module doesn't set any global variables, so you have to store the
return value of `require` somewhere, e.g. in a local variable `class`.

```lua
local class = require( "classy" )
```

Result of the call to `require` is a [functable][1], a table that can
also be called like a function. The function call syntax is used for
defining classes, while the table holds the helper functions defined
by this OO module.

```lua
local SomeClass = class( "SomeClass" )
print( class.name( SomeClass ) )                 -->  SomeClass

local AnotherClass = class( "AnotherClass", SomeClass )
print( class.is_a( AnotherClass, SomeClass ) )   -->  1
```

When defining a class, the first argument is the class name, which can
be retrieved for a class/object table later using the `class.name()`
function. Additional arguments are base classes, which must be class
tables returned by previous calls to this module.

The resulting class tables have `__call` metamethods defined, so that
you can create an object of a class using function call syntax. You
can define methods simply by storing a function in the class table. Of
course, the usual colon-syntax is supported. If the class has an
`__init` method defined, this method is called during construction of
an object with the object as first argument, and any additional
arguments passed from the call of the class table. The `__init` method
is never inherited by sub-classes, but you can of course call it via
the class table (e.g. in the constructor of a sub-class).

```lua
function SomeClass:__init( a, b )
  self.a, self.b = a, b
end

function AnotherClass:__init( a, b, c )
  SomeClass.__init( self, a, b )
  self.c = c
end

function AnotherClass:print()
  print( self.a, self.b, self.c )
end

local anObject = AnotherClass( 1, 2, 3 )
anObject:print()                     -->  1       2       3
```

Creating classes and defining methods (especially on classes with many
sub-classes) involve some bookkeeping, so that object construction and
method lookup on objects can be fast.

Adding methods to base classes will also make them available for
objects of derived classes. Metamethods are *not* inherited, however.

```lua
function SomeClass:say_hello()
  print( "hello from " .. class.name( self ) )
end

local someObject = SomeClass( 1, 2 )
someObject:say_hello()               -->  hello from SomeClass
anObject:say_hello()                 -->  hello from AnotherClass

function SomeClass:__add( rhs )
  return SomeClass( self.a + rhs.a, self.b + rhs.b )
end

local _ = someObject + someObject    -->  ok!
local _ = anObject + anObject        -->  error!
```

You can pretty much define any metamethod except `__index` (which
is already used for method lookup), and maybe `__gc` (works on tables
starting from Lua 5.2, and only for objects created *after* the `__gc`
metamethod has been set).

If you override a method in a sub-class, and you want to call the
method of the base class, you can use the class table of the base
class for that.

```lua
function AnotherClass:say_hello()
  SomeClass.say_hello( self )
  print( "good bye" )
end

anObject:say_hello()                 -->  hello from AnotherClass
                                     -->  good bye
```

If the type of `self` is not sufficient to select a suitable method,
you can define a multimethod:

```lua
local multi = class.multimethod( 1, 2 ) -- dispatch via args 1 and 2

class.overload( multi, SomeClass, SomeClass, function( a, b )
  print( "SomeClass, SomeClass" )
end )

class.overload( multi, SomeClass, AnotherClass, function( a, b )
  print( "SomeClass, AnotherClass" )
end )

class.overload( multi, AnotherClass, AnotherClass, function( a, b )
  print( "AnotherClass, AnotherClass" )
end )

multi( anObject, anObject )          -->  AnotherClass, AnotherClass
multi( someObject, anObject )        -->  SomeClass, AnotherClass
multi( someObject, someObject )      -->  SomeClass, SomeClass
multi( anObject, someObject )        -->  SomeClass, SomeClass
```

This also works for builtin types, and for type checking functions
following the same protocol as [`io.type`][2] or [`lpeg.type`][3]:

```lua
local dispatch = class.multimethod( 1, 2 )

class.overload( dispatch, "string", "number", function( a, b )
  print( "string, number" )
end )
class.overload( dispatch, "number", "string", function( a, b )
  print( "number, string" )
end )
class.overload( dispatch, "number", io.type, "file", function( a, b )
  print( "number, file" )
end )

dispatch( "xy", 2 )                  -->  string, number
dispatch( 2, "xy" )                  -->  number, string
dispatch( 3, io.stdout )             -->  number, file
dispatch( 1, 2 )                     -->  error!
```

For builtin types the argument type must match exactly (there are no
superclasses to take into account). Of course, you can also mix
classes and builtin types.

And that's basically it!

##                             Reference                            ##

####                            class()                           ####

    class( class_name [, ...] ) ==> table
        class_name: string   -- name of the class
        ...       : table*   -- class tables for base classes

Calling the result of the require call (named `class` in the above
code snippet) creates a new class table. Zero or more base classes may
be given as extra arguments after the class name. There is no general
superclass like `Object` from which all classes inherit by default!

The resulting class has a `__call` metamethod defined for constructing
objects of this class, and basically acts like a normal table, except
that fields with metamethod-names don't end up in the class table.
Iteration via `pairs()` provides all available fields of the class
(including fields of base classes), but it only works for Lua 5.2 and
up.

####                          class.of()                          ####

    class.of( object ) ==> table/nil

The `of` function returns the class table of an object, or `nil` if
the argument isn't an object created via this module.

####                         class.name()                         ####

    class.name( obj_or_cls ) ==> string/nil
        obj_or_cls: table    -- an object table or a class table

The `name` function returns the class name specified during class
definition for a given object or class. If the argument is not a class
table created using this module or an object of such a class, this
function returns `nil`.

####                         class.is_a()                         ####

    class.is_a( obj_or_cls, base ) ==> integer/nil
        obj_or_cls: table    -- an object table or a class table
        base      : table    -- a class table

The `is_a` function checks if a given object or class is a sub-class
of certain class.

####                         class.cast()                         ####

    class.cast( object, class ) ==> object
        class: table         -- a class table

The `cast` function changes the class of a given object (or normal
table) to the given class (it replaces the metatable) and returns the
object. No constructors are called in the process, so the object might
be in an invalid state for the new class. If you want to prevent
objects of a certain class to be casted, define a `__metatable` field
in the metatable.

####                       class.delegate()                       ####

    class.delegate( class, fname [, ...] ) ==> table
        class: table         -- a class table
        fname: string        -- name of a field in the objects
        ...  : table/string* -- vararg list or array of method names

The `delegate` function creates new methods for a class that forward
to methods on an object stored inside of objects of this class. The
stored object can be found via the given fieldname. The method names
to delegate can be specified as varargs or in an array. The class
table is returned.

####                      class.multimethod()                     ####

    class.multimethod( ... ) ==> function   -- returns the multimethod
        ...  : integer,integer*   -- indices of polymorphic parameters

The `multimethod` function creates a function, that tries to dispatch
calls to suitable registered functions depending on the arguments
passed. Only arguments specified during the creation of the
multimethod are used to search for a matching implementation.

####                       class.overload()                       ####

    class.overload( mm, ... )
        mm   : function           -- the multimethod
        ...  : (string/table/(function,string))*, function

Calling this function adds an overload to a given multimethod, i.e. a
new set of parameter types for which a new implementation method is
called.  The additional arguments to `overload` are either strings
(names of builtin types), class tables (for classes), or pairs of a
function and a string for external type checking functions like
[`io.type`][2] (the function is the type checker, the string is the
type name to match). The number of types for this call must match the
number of arguments to the original `class.multimethod` call. The last
argument of `overload` is the function (or anything callable) to
register for this specific overload.
