Nancy is a simple web site builder. It has just one construct:
context-dependent file inclusion. With this single feature you can
build pretty much any web site whose logical structure mirrors its URL
layout, and which does not rely on dynamically computed content, out
of fragments (of HTML, CSS, text, and whatever else you like) plus
other files (images, audio &c.).

Nancy is available from http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Nancy/. It is
free software, licensed under the GNU GPL.

See "Nancy user's guide.pdf" for instructions.

Any questions, comments, or bug reports should be sent to
rrt@sc3d.org.
