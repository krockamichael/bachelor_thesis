# Hello-World
## An Example Kong Plugin

[![][kong-logo]][kong-url]

## Summary

This example plugin leverages the helpers and kong source for running integration tests without having to be in the kong source tree. You can also use this as a starter for your own Kong plugins.

It assumes that you have a clone of the kong source code since we change to that directory for execution of the tests in the plugin project.  

We also assume that you can already successfully execute the integration tests on the kong source code (`make test-integration`).  Note that this requires both postgres and cassandra to be installed and accessible from your kong instance.  

NOTE: In order to run the `test-plugins` make target you also need redis installed.

If everything is working as it should, you can continue.  

Credit for most of the code in the plugin goes to  [CÃ©dric Tran-Xuan](http://streamdata.io/blog/developing-an-helloworld-kong-plugin/). The [article](http://streamdata.io/blog/developing-an-helloworld-kong-plugin/) is for an older version of Kong, but it is a great starting place.


## Development

## Setup

Setting up your development environment.

1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/README.md#development) to setup your Kong development environment.

2. Set the `KONG_PATH` environment variable or update the variable in the [Makefile](./Makefile) to point it to your Kong source dir. (default: /kong)

### Run the plugin test suite

Before you start development on your custom plugin, make sure you can run the full test suite with your current Kong source.

```
$ make test-all
```

You should see something like this.

```
vagrant@precise64:/kong-plugins/kong-plugin-hello-world$ make test-all

## Notes

I started with the kong-vagrant project for my development environment.  I installed postgres, and redis, added some items to the path... I might make a PR against that repo...
