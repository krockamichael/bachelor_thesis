tostring (e)
------------

  Receives an argument of any type and converts it to a string in a reasonable
  format. For complete control of how numbers are converted, use
  `string.format`.

  If the metatable of `e` has a `"__tostring"` field, `tostring` calls the
  corresponding value with `e` as argument, and uses the result of the call as
  its result.
