This library provides the functionality of the debug interface to Lua
programs. You should exert care when using this library. The functions
provided here should be used exclusively for debugging and similar tasks, such
as profiling. Please resist the temptation to use them as a usual programming
tool: they can be very slow. Moreover, several of its functions violate some
assumptions about Lua code (e.g., that variables local to a function cannot be
accessed from outside or that userdata metatables cannot be changed by Lua
code) and therefore can compromise otherwise secure code.

All functions in this library are provided inside the `debug` table. All
functions that operate over a thread have an optional first argument which is
the thread to operate over. The default is always the current thread.
