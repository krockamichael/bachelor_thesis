Help [=[

unpack (list [, i [, j]])
-------------------------

  Returns the elements from the given table. This function is equivalent to

      return list[i], list[i+1], ..., list[j]

  except that the above code can be written only for a fixed number of
  elements. By default, `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of the list, as defined
  by the length operator.

  __See also__: length operator, `help("length")`.
