io.input ([file])
-----------------

  When called with a file name, it opens the named file (in text mode), and
  sets its handle as the default input file. When called with a file handle,
  it simply sets this file handle as the default input file. When called
  without parameters, it returns the current default input file.

  In case of errors this function raises the error, instead of returning an
  error code.
