coroutine.status (co)
---------------------

  Returns the status of coroutine `co`, as a string: "running", if the
  coroutine is running (that is, it called `status`); "suspended", if the
  coroutine is suspended in a call to `yield`, or if it has not started
  running yet; "normal" if the coroutine is active but not running (that is,
  it has resumed another coroutine); and "dead" if the coroutine has finished
  its body function, or if it has stopped with an error.
