dofile (filename)
-----------------

  Opens the named file and executes its contents as a Lua chunk. When called
  without arguments, `dofile` executes the contents of the standard input
  (stdin). Returns all values returned by the chunk. In case of errors,
  `dofile` propagates the error to its caller (that is, `dofile` does not run
  in protected mode).
