os.execute ([command])
----------------------

  This function is equivalent to the C function `system`. It passes `command`
  to be executed by an operating system shell. It returns a status code, which
  is system-dependent. If `command` is absent, then it returns nonzero if a
  shell is available and zero otherwise.
