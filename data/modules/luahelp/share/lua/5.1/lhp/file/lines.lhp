file:lines ()
-------------

  Returns an iterator function that, each time it is called, returns a new
  line from the file. Therefore, the construction

        for line in file:lines() do body end

  will iterate over all lines of the file. (Unlike `io.lines`, this function
  does not close the file when the loop ends.)
