table.foreachi (table, f)
-------------------------

  Executes the given `f` over the numerical indices of `table`. For each
  index, `f` is called with the index and respective value as arguments.
  Indices are visited in sequential order, from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the
  length of the table. If `f` returns a non-**nil** value, then the loop is
  broken and this value is returned as the result of `table.foreachi`.
