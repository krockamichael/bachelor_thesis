table.foreach (table, f)
------------------------

  Executes the given `f` over all elements of `table`. For each element, `f`
  is called with the index and respective value as arguments. If `f` returns a
  non-**nil** value, then the loop is broken, and this value is returned as
  the final value of `table.foreach`.

  See `next` for extra information about table traversals.
