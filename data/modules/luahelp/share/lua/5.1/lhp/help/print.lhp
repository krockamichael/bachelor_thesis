Help [[

help.print (desc)
-----------------

  Prints help description `desc`. This function is used internally by `help`
  to print help pages. As an example, here's a simple pager:

          help.print = function(desc)
            local pipe = io.popen("less", "w")
            pipe:write(desc)
            pipe:close()
          end

  LuaHelp provides a module `helpman` that translates pages written in
  markdown to troff and prints them using a suitable pager.
