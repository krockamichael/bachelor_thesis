string.sub (s, i [, j])
-----------------------

  Returns the substring of `s` that starts at `i` and continues until `j`; `i`
  and `j` may be negative. If `j` is absent, then it is assumed to be equal to
  -1 (which is the same as the string length). In particular, the call
  `string.sub(s,1,j)` returns a prefix of `s` with length `j`, and
  `string.sub(s,-i)` returns a suffix of `s` with length `i`.
