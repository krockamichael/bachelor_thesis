Installation instructions:
**************************

You want to use luarocks. You can install this with a simple

   # luarocks make rockspec/getopt-1.0.1-1.rockspec

There is an included Makefile, which did work the last time I tested
it; it's messy, error prone, and requires that you edit it to suit
your environment. YMMV.

Bugs:
*****

* More tests need to be written! Things like...

  o POSIXALLY_CORRECT environment variable (and leading '+') behavior
  o intentionally passing invalid types of options to getopt.std and .long
  o hacking optind during a callback
  o more thorough optional argument testing (and short '::')
  o error callback testing with returned ":" rather than "?"

* The busted-based tests (in the spec/ subdirectory) are fragile. They
  depend on output that's getopt-implementation-specific, and require
  modules that aren't part of luarocks. (This is why I built the new
  set of tests in the tests/ subdirectory without 'busted'.)

* Much of this code is repurposed from my lua-cyrussasl module. Which
  means it should be abstracted in some common way, rather than
  copy-and-pasted.
